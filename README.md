# Project Overview:

This project explores the impact of fluoride levels in Alberta’s water supply on dental health, with a focus on Calgary vs. Edmonton.
Calgary removed fluoride from its water in 2011, and reintroduced it in June 2025.
Other cities in Alberta (e.g., Edmonton) continued fluoridation during this period.
By comparing available chemical water data and dental health outcomes before and after 2011, we aim to visualize how fluoride levels may have affected oral health.
The final deliverable will be an interactive webpage that combines:
Data visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, interactive graphs)
3D models of teeth showing different fluoride exposure levels (too little, normal, too much)
Explanations and conclusions from our research

# Goals:
Create a user-friendly, visually engaging, and informative platform for exploring fluoride’s impact on dental health.
Bridge data analysis, 3D modeling, and web development into one cohesive project.
Provide clear conclusions and insights backed by real data.

# Frontend Setup:
The frontend is built with React and includes 3D/interactive components.
To set up your development environment:
**Ensure you are in your project directory before running**:
npm install three
npm install @react-three/fiber
npm install @react-three/drei
npm install @react-spring/three

# Project Components:

**Software (Frontend Development):**
Build the webpage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
Add interactive graphs (users can explore fluoride data instead of static screenshots).
Include a teeth simulation component where users can visualize the effects of fluoride.
Website hosting.

**Architecture & Mechanical (3D Modeling):**
Start with 2D sketches to brainstorm designs.
Develop 3D models of human teeth in three conditions:
Too little fluoride
Normal fluoride
Too much fluoride
Use CAD software (e.g., AutoCAD, Rhino, Blender) to design models.
Incorporate real dental symptoms from Alberta Health or reliable health sources.
Publish the final 3D designs directly on the webpage in glb format.

**Chemical (Data Collection & Analysis):**
Collect data on fluoride levels in Calgary’s water supply before and after 2011.
Compare with other Albertan areas.
Unfortunately we werent able to gather appropriate data on dental visits or oral health statistics.
Organize the dataset in Excel with fields such as:
Area
Flouride amount
Year
Source
Use Power BI to create bar charts, pie charts, and interactive dashboards.
Embed these visuals into the webpage.

**Documentation & Deliverables:**
All team members will contribute to documentation:
Write clear explanations of each webpage component.
Provide background context on fluoride in Alberta.
Summarize conclusions from the collected data and visualizations.
Maintain GitHub documentation for transparency and reproducibility.
