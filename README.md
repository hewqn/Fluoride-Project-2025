So apparently Calgary removed fluoride from their water since 2011 but they’re gonna put it back in June , but other cities in Alberta kept it since. So maybe we could see if we could do research on how that effected the average Calgarians teeth versus to those in like Edmonton for example and also any data that’s available before 2011 when Calgary did have fluoride. 

So I was thinking like an Interactive Webpage/ Study of fluoride on teeth in Alberta 

Software: 
Code the webpage using html, css, js and react. add interactive elements. Maybe add an interactive component that can let a user add fluoride to the teeth see effects. Make it look interesting to read and simple for humans. When uploading the components below, let them still be interactive to the user (for example , the user can play around with the bar graph about the fluoride data, instead of it being a screenshot.  potentially host the page.

Architecture & Mechanical: 
You can start with a 2D sketch for brainstorming but then transform it into a 3D design of human teeth into 3 parts: with too little fluoride, normal fluoride, and too much fluoride. You can use autoCAD software or rhino or whatever worked best in your design classes. To sketch the symptoms you can grab them from Alberta health or just any health page/ google. Then the final 3D designs will be published on the webpage.

Chemical:  
Find data analysis of fluoride in water before 2011 in Calgary and after 2011. And also I’m not sure if this exists but maybe dental visits related to fluoride before 2011 in Calgary, and after 2011. This data can be research done by other uni students in the past, official water analysis that the city releases or anything similar. If finding data before 2011 is too hard, you can use recent data in Calgary, so the data that includes no fluoride, and then compare it to recent data in other cities like Edmonton etc. and also find data on dental visits related to fluoride during the same year , if exists.
Take this data and fill an excel sheet with it with cells that separate the city , the chemical name, the amount ,the unit, the year, etc. 
then from this excel sheet plug it into power bi for visualization. You can make bar graphs and pie charts . So then this will also be added to the webpage. 

All of us: writing documentation in github repo and on the webpage to like explain the elements on there. Also to write our conclusions after doing the research.
